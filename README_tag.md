Description: This tag was the source of performance analysis numbers presented in the IEEE micro
2020 article. It contains several novel performance tricks which were later integrated into mainline
BlackParrot code. It is here in case anyone would like to reproduce the coremark score presented,
but the microarchitectural hacks have been converted to efficient solutions
